# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022), written in Rust. I love seeing the variety of solution other people come up with, so I decided to post my own.

Disclaimers:

- I am using this to learn Rust, so the code probably won't be great to start out.
- I am certain there are much smarter solutions than the ones I went for.
- I may catch up on a few days at once depending on how life goes.
- I sometimes write code anticipating a specific twist for part 2 that doesn't appear, resulting in some probably odd code decisions.
